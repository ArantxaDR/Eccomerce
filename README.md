## Project decision :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The app has been organized in two parts:

* A **home** with a display of the products, a search bar and a pagination to see every product in the API.
* A **details** in where you can see more details about an especific product. 

For the **styles**:

* The use of [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), as it helps to keep large stylesheets organized and it's easy to read.
